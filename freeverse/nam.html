		<h1>Nam</h1>

		<p>
		The place of my uncle's birth,<br>
		and where he was stung<br>
		thirty years later by the war<br>
		which took the form of<br>
		a jellyfish and followed him across<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		Waters unanimous,
		An ocean of rising and falling hands,<br>
		Their palms cupped to catch moonlight<br>
		Their fists knocking in the dark.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		From above, we commemorate<br>
		the underwater stargazers<br>
		with folksongs stitched into<br>
		the hemlines of our skirts,<br>
		longing to see the sun.<br>
		</p>
	</div>	

		<div class="left">
		<p>
		And the time when Ma bid us<br>
		goodbye forever,<br>
		neither of us knowing<br>
		forever.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		And when we reached the other shore,<br>
		cutting away the threads<br>
		with the first pair<br>
		of scissors we could find.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		How could we have said<br>
		not enough<br>
		opening the slips<br>
		of green paper to the sun?<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		To think of Ma by lamplight<br>
		the needle leading<br>
		the thread like a blind<br>
		pilgrim by the hand,<br>
		as the rest of us slept<br>
		in the cloth of night.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		For we would wake<br>
		with the birds next morning,<br>
		and next morning<br>
		no sound greeted us<br>
		but sea splitting sea.<br>
		</p>
		</div>
		
	<div class="poem">	
		<p>
		Something is lost among the street.<br>
		In a noodle shop it waits as a glass of<br>
		tap water westerners won't drink.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
		A generation passes,<br>
		this country still smells of smoke.<br>
		A generation passes<br>
		this country.
