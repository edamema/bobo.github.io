<h1>Toyota Corolla</h1>
<p>My uncle has<br>
six Toyota Corollas,<br>
patient in the garage<br>
and beside the curb<br>
like a fleet<br>
in the flesh.<br>
<br>
He lives in a place<br>
and in everything that<br>
a place is.<br>
<br>
She'll take the car,<br>
my mother's daughter, and drive<br>
to places that are only<br>
places and nothing more<br>
<br>
past Toyota Corollas like<br>
a vision scrawled<br>
onto the surface of a lake<br>
or a word uttered from heaven<br>
in the nick of time.<br>
<br>
Toyotus Corollus<br>
Corollas Corollos<br>
<br>
She says there's no mistake about it...<br>
through and through<br>
and through freeways<br>
through freeways<br>
<br>
i saw it on the way<br>
there to Auntie's house:<br>
A vein, peeking through a break<br>
in the skin. A fish whose mouth<br>
breaks the surface of a lake<br>
like dawn.
